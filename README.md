### Hi there 👋

I am a Full Stack Engineer with a drive to expand my knowledge within the tech industry. A few things about myself, I love playing video games. I have since plays games as I was a child when my siblings first introduced to me the nintendo 64. My favorite game was definitely Legends of Zelda Ocarina of Time. I also love watching competitive esports and is a competitive person myself.
